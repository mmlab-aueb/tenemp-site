        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
            The Telepresence-Enhanced Network Music Performance (TENeMP) project will use the
            SPIRIT infrastructure to conduct experiments with Network Music Performance (NMP)
            applications over a 5G network, supporting immersive telepresence equipment and services
            such as holographic communications and avatar-based presence. NMP can be a great
            showcase for both 5G and telepresence technologies. Its stringent latency requirements can
            only be supported by ultra-low latency 5G links and the availability of nearby edge computing
            resources to host multiparty communication servers. The real-life presence which is essential
            for both live music performance and for music teaching can only be met by exploiting
            immersive telepresence technologies that allow the participants to hear and see each other
            from multiple vantage points as part of a 3D scene, rather than as flat images captured on a
            video camera. TENeMP will evaluate the feasibility of different NMP scenarios and topologies
            over pure 5G and mixed 5G networks, explore different ways of supporting multiparty
            scenarios by exploiting edge computing resources, and will integrate future telepresence
            technologies such as holographic communications and avatar-based presence with audio-
            based NMP tools, to provide a unified presence experience for NMP-based performance and
            education. The project will exploit many of the components of the SPIRIT testbeds, from 5G
            connectivity, via telepresence enablers, to edge computing resources, providing a showcase
            for the SPIRIT platform and its capabilities. At the same time, it will not only try to assess the
            feasibility of NMP over the advanced facilities offered by the SPIRIT platform, it will actively
            enhance existing NMP tools with immersive telepresence, providing everyone with access to
            music performance and education, regardless of their location and mobility constraints.
